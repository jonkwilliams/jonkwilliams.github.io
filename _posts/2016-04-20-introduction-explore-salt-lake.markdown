People spends lots of time and expense trying to plan the perfect vacation but have you ever stopped to discover your own city? This website is an attempt to discover my city, Salt Lake City, UT.

Using the <a href="http://www.visitsaltlake.com/trip-planner/visitors-guide/">Salt Lake City Visitors Guide</a> as a roadmap, we'll attempt to explore the Salt Lake City valley.  We will be taking our kids along our adventure so most things we do will have to be kid friendly.

Here is a list of neighboorhoods we'll explore:  
Downtown, Central City, Sugar House, Avenues/Capitol Hill, University/Foothill, Granary District/Ballpark, Airport/Fairgrounds, Cottonwood Heights, Midvale, South Salt Lake, Millcreek, Holladay/Murray, Sandy, Draper, Southwest Valley, West Valley, Big Cottonwood Canyon, Little Cottonwood Canyon, and Great Salt Lake
